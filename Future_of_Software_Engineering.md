# Future of Software Engineering

## How does AI impact CS?

* Less focus on programming itself and more on how to efficiently use the AI to produce
effective code
* Still important to check that the code shows the correct results

## Personal Impact?

* Use opportunities of the programs to create a working and well written code
* Try the new functions in VSC

## Project?
* In cases when the project is stuck to get ideas from AI
* Use an efficient learning method for the AI
* Build the correct reward functions
* Put some randomness in it to try to create better results

## Process of becoming CS

* Use AI to become more productive and use it efficiently
* Learn to correctly tell the AI the input, so that the correct output gets created
* Still be skeptical about the output, donâ€™t blindly trust it (hallucinations)
* See it as an opportunity, not necessarily a danger
* It will be a big part of future CS, therefore important to understand
