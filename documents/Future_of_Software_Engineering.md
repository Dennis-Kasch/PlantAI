# Future of Software Engineering

## How does AI impact CS?

* Less focus on programming itself and more on requirements / software design and  how to efficiently use the AI to produce effective software solutions
* More low code or no code approaches, making programming / software engineering more accessible
* Still important to check that the code shows the correct behavior, therefore competences about software development are still important

## Personal Impact?

* Use opportunities of the programs to create a working and well written code
* Try the new functions in VSC to speed up development tasks, but also the learning process
* Find critical spots and errors in the code more efficiently (time-wise) and optimize them more easily
* Make more complex code easier and faster to understand

## Impact on the project?

* In cases when the project is stuck to get ideas from AI
* Use an efficient learning method for the AI
* Build the correct reward functions
* Put some randomness in it to try to create better results

## Influence on process of becoming a Computer Scientist?

* It will be a big part of future CS, therefore important to understand
* Use AI to become more productive and use it efficiently
* Learn to correctly tell the AI the input, so that the correct output gets created
* Still be skeptical about the output, donâ€™t blindly trust it (hallucinations)
* See AI support as an opportunity, not necessarily a danger (addition/complement instead of replacement), but also know its limits!
