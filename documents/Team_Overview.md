He has experience integrating and accessing databases, including both SQL and NoSQL, though his exposure to NoSQL is limited.
He previously coded in Java, but it has been a while since he transitioned to Python.

### Responsibility

In the PlantAI project, Dennis is assigned the responsibility of examining the integration of tools such as GPT-4 and GitHub Copilot for backend development and the overall development process.
