# PlantAI - Project Plan

This is the project plan for the PlantAI project for Systems and Software Engineering I - WS 23/24, at Goethe University, Frankfurt.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop an Android app (or Android integrated web app) that allows to take pictures of a single plant, perform a visual analysis of it and return an assessment of the plant's health status. Corn plants were chosen as a starting point, although the final decision is still pending and depends on the availability of good data for corn plants. In the first stage the app should only be able to distinguish between healthy or unhealthy plants. But the assessment will eventually consist of the "water level", nutrient sustenance and possible diseases of the plant. For the possible diseases the 3 most common of the selected plant type should be identified.

## Software Architecture

* Android basis + UI (including camera handling)
* Models / algorithms for visual analysis (water level, nutrition, diseases)
* Data(base) management?

## Responsibilities

* **Android development:** 
* **Data Management:** 
* **Methods and technologies** (for visual analysis): Dennis

## Schedule

* **Research Phase (1-2 weeks):** Figure out what data to use, how/if to implement on Android or web, what technology to use and wfor what plant.
* **Implementation phase I (3-4 weeks):** Implement a basic UI that allows to take pictures and receive an assessment that shows if the plant is healthy or not, maybe also water level and/or nutrition.
* **Implementation phase II (3-4 weeks):** Optimize UI and refine assessment to more complexity (nutrition, diseases) . Could possible include further plants when phase I is going well.
* **Delivery phase (1-2 weeks):** Further optimization and bug fixing. Create a final product.

## Risks, Challenges and Counter Measures

* **Availability of data:** Selection of a fitting plant, automated data generation, good research
* **Sickness:** Duos, so there are always two people responsible for a topic
* **Time:** Gradual increments of the app (general health -> water level -> nutrition -> diseases)
